<template><h1 id="navigation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#navigation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Navigation</h1>
<p>Peak includes basic unstyled responsive navigation with two levels. Open <code>resources/views/navigation/_main.antlers.html</code> to make changes. There's a desktop version that only shows on <code>md</code> screens and up as well as a mobile version that shows on smaller screens. AlpineJS takes care of the interactivity. The state of the mobile navigation toggle is defined on the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag in <code>resources/views/layout.antlers.html</code>.</p>
<p>Peak also includes an optional breadcrumbs partial you can find in <code>resources/views/navigation/_breadcrumbs.antlers.html</code>.</p>
