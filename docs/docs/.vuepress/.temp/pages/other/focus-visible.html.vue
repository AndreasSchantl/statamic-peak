<p>Focus-visible solves a lot of issues regarding a11y and styling. To use focus-visible today we need polyfills (for Safari). One in <a href="https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Javascript<OutboundLink/></a> and one in <a href="https://github.com/csstools/postcss-focus-visible" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PostCSS<OutboundLink/></a>. With focus-visible we can make sure the browser only shows an outline when the user navigates with a keyboard. This means no more outlines in Chrome when you click styled buttons.</p>
<p>You can take this even further by using the <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/ring-width" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tailwind CSS Ring utilties<OutboundLink/></a> together with the <code>focus-visible:</code> variant to customize and brand your focus styles.</p>
