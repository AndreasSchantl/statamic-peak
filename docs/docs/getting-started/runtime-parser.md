# Runtime parser

If you want to migrate existing Peak sites to the runtime parser, know you usually only have to do two things:

## Update your form field templates
Change:
```html
{{ old ?= value="{old}" }}
```
to:
```html
{{ old ?= 'value="{old}"' }}
```

The original syntax is simply wrong. It should not have worked in the regex parser but it did due to a bug.

## Don't use double curly braces in tags
Never use double curly braces when `{{ }}` when inside a tag. Change it to single curly braces: `{ }`. This also shouldâ€™ve never worked but it did and even opened up possibilities when using the regex parser so it's widely used.
