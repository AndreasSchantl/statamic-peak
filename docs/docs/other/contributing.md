# Contributing

Contributions and discussions are always welcome, no matter how large or small. Treat each other with respect. Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/studio1902/statamic-peak/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Only propose changes to files in the `/dev` folder. This is the folder you should run as your localhost. From this installed version of Peak we can export the kit's files and move them to root level. 

These docs are initially setup using VuePress 1 by [Robert Guss](https://github.com/robertguss/). Thank you so much! Today we run VuePress 2.
